# Solar-Power-Generation


Solar power generation for home appliances with the help of MATLAB Simulink.
Designed a model for power generation.
PV array solar panel is setup to receive the radiation and convert them as a Power source.
With the help of inverter and filtering circuit , get a pure AC signal which is mainly suitable for home appliances.
This will reduce the electricity consumption.
