# Solar-Power-Generation

In this project,designed a model for SPG.
Generated Solar power for home appliances with the help of MATLAB Simulink.
PV array solar panel is setup to receive the radiation and convert them as a Power source.
With the help of inverter and filtering circuit , we get a pure AC signal which is mainly suitable for home appliances.

Future Scope:
This will reduce the electricity consumption & bill.
